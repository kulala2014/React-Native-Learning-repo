## Create App with Expo and React Native CLI
We can create react native app with both Expo and React Native CLI. But React Native CLI needs we install lots of dependences, so for learning, we just use expo.

### ðŸ‘‡Create First React Native App
We will use create-expo-app to initialize a new Expo app. It is a command line tool that allows us to create a new React Native project with the expo package installed.
<ol>
<li> <strong>Create a new expo app</strong>  -npx create-expo-app <my-app>.</li>
<li><strong>Install Expo client on our cell phone</strong> - We can install the Expo Client on our phone to run the expo app we created.</li>
<li><strong>Start the App</strong> - cd <my-app>, and then use npx expo start</li>
<li><strong>Request/Response Definition</strong> - In REST, the server-side API code defines the request and response format whereas GraphQL gives complete control to the client to define the request and response as per requirement.</li>
</ol>
